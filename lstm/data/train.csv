0,First step towards HTTP/2 automatic pings. (#3874) <enter>  <enter> This changes the executor services in HTTP/2 connection to split up <enter> listener executors (of which there may be many threads) from writer <enter> executors (of which there is one per connection). <enter>  <enter> This adds a scheduled executor job to send pings on an interval. We <enter> don't yet fail the connection if pongs are not received. <enter>  <enter> For follow-up there's some work to remove exising APIs to send pings <enter> through the HTTP/2 APIs.

Spring <enter> Boot provides that artifact via the `spring-boot-starter-cache` starter. <enter>  <enter> It is quite easy to 'only' add the cache library dependencies and forget <enter> about this extra dependencies since `@EnableCaching` is available by <enter> default.

3,Simplify asynchronous executor API.
0,Increase running time of statement. Fixes #963. <enter>  <enter> The time between starting the statement and calling the future is <enter> arbitrary. Now the execution time of the statement is very very long. <enter> This ensures that the statement is not already finished when the <enter> future is called.
0,"Support path discovery for main dispatcher servlet <enter>  <enter> Add an `DispatcherServletPath` interface which provides a much more <enter> consistent way to discover the path of the main dispatcher servet. <enter>  <enter> Prior to this commit, auto-configurations would often make use of the <enter> `ServerProperties` class to discover the dispatcher servlet path. This <enter> mechanism isn't very explicit and also makes it hard for us to relocate <enter> that property in Spring Boot 2.1. <enter>  <enter> This commit also reverts most of fddc9e9c7e since it is now clear that <enter> the supporting multiple dispatcher servlet paths will be much more <enter> involved that we originally anticipated. <enter>  <enter> Closes gh-13834"

0,"Fix MavenSettings ?handling of profiles activated by a file <enter>  <enter> Previously, MavenSettings used a FileProfileActivator with no <enter> PathTransformer. If a settings.xml file contains a file-activated <enter> profile this would result in an NPE within Maven. This was made worse <enter> by the NPE not being included in the resulting failure message which <enter> hampered diagnosis of the problem. <enter>  <enter> This commit updates MavenSettings to configure its FileProfileActivator <enter> with a PathTransformer.

0,"Whole operation timeouts <enter>  <enter> Strictly-speaking this change is backwards-incompatible because it adds <enter> a new method to the Call interface. The method returns the call's timeout. <enter>  <enter> The trickiest part of this is signaling the end of the call, which <enter> occurs after the last byte is consumed of the last follow up request, <enter> or when the call fails.

The issue reported was actually <enter> about the use of Thread.interrupt(), not timeouts, but the <enter> behavior change modified both behavior for interrupt and <enter> timeout. <enter>  <enter> PR #1388 split the handling of exceptions so that separate <enter> code now handles connection errors from that which handles <enter> request/response errors. It faithfully kept the behavior <enter> from PR #1257. <enter>  <enter> The modification of the timeout behavior during *connection* <enter> caused problems on Android.
